      program that supports VST...This plugin is tested the most with <A 
      href="http://www.ableton.com/" target=_blank>Ableton Live</A>&nbsp;and <A 
      href="http://www.plogue.com/" target=_blank>Plogue Bidule</A>, but has 
      been checked out with <A 
      href="http://www.steinberg.net/ProductPage_sb.asp?Product_ID=2442&amp;Langue_ID=7" 
      target=_blank>Nuendo/Cubase</A>,&nbsp;<A href="http://www.xt-hq.com/"

      href="http://www.steinberg.net/ProductPage_sb.asp?Product_ID=2130" 
      target=_blank>V-Stack.</A>&nbsp;Both Ableton and Bidule currently offer 
      free trial versions - tobyBear's host is Donationware.</P>
      <P>You need to copy the plugin to your vst plugins directory.&nbsp; In 
      Windows this is usually <STRONG>c:/program 
      files/steinberg/vstplugins</STRONG>.&nbsp; In Mac OSX this is 
      probably&nbsp;<STRONG>Users-&gt;(your 
      name)-&gt;Library-&gt;Audio-&gt;Plug-Ins-&gt;VST</STRONG>&nbsp;...or...<STRONG> 
      Library-&gt;Audio-&gt;Plug-Ins-&gt;VST</STRONG> .&nbsp; Ableton will tell 
      you the correct folder if you go to Options-&gt;Preferences...-&gt;Plug In 
      tab under "VST plug-in custom folder". Make sure you also copy the 
      metronome file into the same directory and don't rename either one.&nbsp; 
      You can put them in a subdirectory if you like.</P>

      will turn gray and the "In" will light up orange - now just plug in your 
      instrument and play.&nbsp; To play&nbsp;an audio file, use the Tab key to

      <P><FONT size=1>You should now see the tempo light flashing and the bars 
      counting from 1 to 8.&nbsp; This is "Tap Tempo" mode - one of the 
      <STRONG>4 basic ways</STRONG> the loopy llama works.&nbsp; You can switch 
      between these modes&nbsp;using the <STRONG>"Set Tempo To" 
      slider</STRONG>.&nbsp;&nbsp;In "Tap Tempo" and "Endpoints"&nbsp;mode Loopy 
      Llama is more&nbsp;like a stand-alone footpedal than a plug-in.&nbsp; It 
      starts in Tap Tempo mode just so you get the flashy lights first 
      thing.</FONT></P>
      <P><STRONG>Endpoints mode</STRONG> is what&nbsp;most people 
      are&nbsp;expecting from a looper&nbsp;- it's the way the DL-4 and many 
      other footpedal loopers work.&nbsp; You tap the record button once to mark 
      the start of a loop and again&nbsp;when you reach&nbsp;the end (with a 
      mouse, keyboard, or MIDI controller) - poof, it immediately begins 
      looping.&nbsp; That's it!&nbsp; It will continue recording, adding to the 
      exiting loop.&nbsp; Hitting record after that will turn on and off 
      overdubbing but won't affect the loop length.&nbsp; If you want it to stop 
      recording right at the second endpoint you can hit play insted of 
      record.&nbsp; Tempo and beats are not necessary and can be ignored.&nbsp; 
      Making a well timed loop is&nbsp;hard - you will quickly find that expert 
      loopers make it look easy to hit buttons with precise enough 
      timing&nbsp;for a smooth loop...it's an art and you will need 
      practice!&nbsp;</P><SPAN

      style="MARGIN-TOP: -118px; MARGIN-LEFT: -117px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> 
      <P><STRONG>Tap tempo mode</STRONG> brings an exciting new element to 
      looping: it quantizes your endpoints so you don't have to worry about your 
      timing with the record button.&nbsp; It assumes you will be playing along 
      to&nbsp;the click track...you must first&nbsp;tap in the tempo (presumably 
      with a MIDI foot controller) or type it into the tempo box.&nbsp; Once you 
      have&nbsp;the tempo and beats set&nbsp;you can hit the record button to 
      start looping - whatever beat you were nearest to will be the 
      beat&nbsp;the loop&nbsp;starts on.&nbsp;&nbsp;When you are ready to end 
      the loop (say after 16 beats)&nbsp;hit record or play in time with the 
      beat - you don't have to be exact, it will round it to the nearest 
      beat.&nbsp; One huge bonus to using this&nbsp;is you can loop while 
      playing with a group of musicians live. You tap in the tempo&nbsp;before 
      the song starts&nbsp;and all play to the click track - or mute the click 
      track and tap along until the metronome matches the group's beat and you 
      can unmute it.&nbsp; In theory you could all watch the beat light instead 
      of listening - good luck with that.</P>
      <H2>3.&nbsp;Looping in sync with the host</H2>
      <P>The "Tempo Sync" and "Transport Lock" modes work like "Tap Tempo" mode, 
      but they get their tempo from the host program... in this case the current 
      tempo in Ableton Live (it is set on the top left or automated).&nbsp; If 
      you want to loop along to pre-recorded tracks where you already know the 
      tempo then you would use these 2 modes.&nbsp; They make it extremely easy 
      to make loops since you don't have to worry about hitting buttons in time 
      - the loop is always exactly the length it needs to be so you just hit 
      record when you want to.&nbsp; Like tap tempo&nbsp;they will quantize to 
      the nearest beat so foot timing is not an issue.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Tempo Sync mode</STRONG>&nbsp;locks in the tempo, but the start 
      point of the loop is up to you. The downbeat can be moved by hitting the 
      play button before or during the loop.&nbsp; The loop can be paused, 
      cleared or replayed at any time.&nbsp; You control the length of the loop 
      by typing in the number of beats.&nbsp; Start looping by hitting record - 
      notice that it counts the next downbeat as the 1.&nbsp; The tap tempo 
      button and tempo box are disabled.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Transport Lock mode</STRONG> follows the host even 
      closer.&nbsp; It locks into the current beat of the song so the loop will 
      always play back in the same place relative to the song.&nbsp; If you 
      rewind the song a few beats it will rewind the loop a few beats to match, 
      etc...&nbsp; It even pauses and plays whenever you stop and start playback 
      in the host, which also means the pause, play, and tap tempo buttons are 
      disabled.&nbsp; If you hit play it will set the current beat to be the 
      first.</P>

      bunch of times to sound like Max Headroom or&nbsp;a bad DJ.&nbsp; If you

      CLR)</STRONG> Serves 2 functions.&nbsp; If you are not recording it will 
      completely erase the loop that is playing back.&nbsp; If you are recording 
      it becomes an "undo" button so whatever you overdubbed on the current pass 
      of the loop will be ignored.&nbsp; Recording will resume when the next 
      loop cycle starts, so you can keep trying to play the part you want and 
      undo-ing it until you get it right.&nbsp; If you hit Clear twice during 
      one pass of a loop it will completely clear the loop just like if you 
      weren't recording...so be careful not to double click it if you don't want 
      to (this may become a setting later).&nbsp; The "LOOP" light will go out 
      when a loop is cleared.</P>

      unpause it. By popular demand there is a setting at the bottom so when you 
      unpause the loop it will start over from the beginning.&nbsp; Hitting Play 
      while it is paused will take you to the beginning of the loop and unpause 
      it.&nbsp; This button is disabled in Transport Lock mode.&nbsp; (The

      of a loop.&nbsp; It only works in Tap Tempo mode.&nbsp; It can be 
      especially useful if you are using a host like Bidule that will allow the 
      plugin to control the master tempo - that way you can sync other plugins 
      to the Loopy Llama and control the tempo on the fly by tapping.</P>

      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 40px; HEIGHT: 44px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -106px; MARGIN-LEFT: -43px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> The Direction 
      button</STRONG> (the orange "DIR") can make you some crazy sounds!&nbsp; 
      Click it and the loop will begin playing backwards at the start of the 
      next cycle.&nbsp; To hear it forwards again click the Driection button 
      again and it will flip back at the next cycle.&nbsp; Pretty 
      straightforward right?&nbsp; Lets take it a step further then... </P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 40px; HEIGHT: 43px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -111px; MARGIN-LEFT: -78px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> Look at <STRONG>the Reverse 
      Mode button</STRONG> (the grey "REV").&nbsp; It has a continuous cycle 
      pictured on it meaning that it is in "Immediate Reverse" mode:&nbsp; 
      Whatever you played will immediately be reversed at the end of a 
      cycle.&nbsp; So you play a few bars and hear them in reverse, then play a 
      few more then they are also reversed when they play back.&nbsp; You can 
      set this to "Relative Reverse" (a single grey turn pictured on the button) 
      so that it doesn't immediately flip what you play at the end of every 
      loop.&nbsp; This way&nbsp;you can build&nbsp;loops normally, then when you 
      hit the Direction button all of what you played will be reversed and you 
      can build on top of that...and then flip it again so what you just played 
      is backwards and what you originally played is forwards!&nbsp; You'll 
      forget what direction you started the loop in no time!</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 71px; HEIGHT: 86px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -22px; MARGIN-LEFT: -234px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> 
      <STRONG>Llamatronics</STRONG> are a tribute to <A 
      href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frippertronics" 
      target=_blank>frippertronics</A> and decaying loops... Looping goes a step 
      further when you set <STRONG>the feedback slider&nbsp;</STRONG>to less 
      than infinite.&nbsp; Your loops evolve as the original ideas fade and the 
      newer ideas are more prevalent...you must refresh the old ideas to keep 
      them alive and so the loop itself is alive and always changing - it's all 
      very metaphysical and involves candles and incense if you do it for too 
      long.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 42px; HEIGHT: 84px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -26px; MARGIN-LEFT: -306px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>The "LPF FREQ." 
      slider</STRONG> (short for Low Pass Filter Frequency) works similar to the 
      feedback slider except that it only decays the high frequencies with every 
      pass.&nbsp; This sounds more like an analog tape loop and is used with or 
      in place of the feedback slider to get&nbsp;a warmer more mellow sound 
      from older ideas as they decay.&nbsp; It's the way sound gets muffled when 
      you make a copy of a copy of a copy of a tape (does anybody use tapes 
      anymore?). The LPF is off when the slider is at it's top position whereas 
      the bottom position is a very drastic cut.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 40px; HEIGHT: 82px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -27px; MARGIN-LEFT: -352px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>The "Tape Hiss" 
      slider</STRONG> adds tape hiss for an even more authentic tape 
      sound.&nbsp; It's actually just white noise - I didn't put too much effort 
      into duplicating the sound of tape (there are other plugins for 
      that).&nbsp; But in conjuntion with the LPF it can give you a nice 
      textural decay like you would get with&nbsp;that real tape looper that's 
      going for thousands on eBay.</P>
      <H2>6. Additional Features</H2>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 104px; HEIGHT: 25px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -161px; MARGIN-LEFT: -213px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>Record starts at 
      next:</STRONG>&nbsp; This can delay when recording starts so you don't 
      have to time when you hit the record button perfectly.&nbsp; The settings 
      are "Sample", "Beat", and "Loop".&nbsp; Sample is the default setting and 
      recording starts immediately after you hit the Record button.&nbsp; "Beat" 
      will make it so it doesn't start recording until the next beat after you 
      hit the button.&nbsp; "Loop" waits until the first beat of the loop to 
      start recording.&nbsp; This&nbsp;only applies to overdubs, not the first 
      loop points, except in Transport Lock mode.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 86px; HEIGHT: 19px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -184px; MARGIN-LEFT: -217px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>1 Loop Mode 
      checkbox:</STRONG>&nbsp; This handy little feature changes how the record 
      button behaves.&nbsp; If it is checked it will only record 1 pass of the 
      loop after the next cycle.&nbsp; So if you have an 8 bar loop and you hit 
      record on bar&nbsp;6 it will record bars 6-8 and 1-8 then turn off 
      recording automatically.&nbsp; If you hit Record again before it is done 
      it will record the next pass of the loop also.&nbsp; THIS IS IMPORTANT: In 
      this mode you can't turn off recording by hitting the record button - you 
      just have to wait until the end of the loop.&nbsp; If you keep hitting the 
      Record button it will keep recording indefinitely.&nbsp; It doesn't count 
      the number of times you hit it, so you have to hit it at least once for 
      each&nbsp;pass you want to record during the previous cycle.</P>
      <P><SPAN 
      style="FLOAT: left; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 72px; HEIGHT: 73px"><IMG 
      style="MARGIN-TOP: -127px; MARGIN-LEFT: -320px" 
      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>Fade 
      Time:</STRONG>&nbsp; When you are recording something you can't just start 
      and stop recording instantly - the jump from silence to signal will create 
      a pop.&nbsp; So there is a small fade in and out when you turn recording 
      on and off.&nbsp; This slider sets the length of the fade from instant to 
      1/8 of a second.&nbsp; It defaults to about 256 samples (depending on your 
      samplerate) which is about the smallest fade you can have without a 
      pop.&nbsp; You may prefer a longer smoother fade in but&nbsp;that may make 
      it harder to time loop points.&nbsp; It also affects the ends of reversed 
      parts when Reversing playback in Immediate Reverse mode - since a reversed 
      part is no longer a continuous signal it must also have it's ends 
      faded.&nbsp; A long fade can create an audible start and stop point in 
      heavily layered immedate reversed loops.</P>
      <H2>7. Boring Technical Features</H2>
      <P>The bottom row of "minutia" from left to right:</P>
      <P><SPAN

      <STRONG>unpaws-&gt;play</STRONG> checkbox sets it so when you unpause a 
      playback it starts over from the beginning of the loop instead of where 
      you paused it at.</P>

      box</STRONG> sets the minimum number of taps to average to get the 
      tempo.&nbsp; If you keep tapping after this number of taps it averages the 
      most recent ones only.</P>

      record, play, clear, pause, tap, dir, fade, lpf, met -</STRONG> These 
      boxes determine the MIDI CC or Note number that will trigger the main 
      buttons.&nbsp; You would have to make sure Loopy Llama is receiving MIDI 
      which I don't know how to do in Ableton.&nbsp; Many hosts already have 
      MIDI assignment functionality and don't need to use these...for example in 
      Ableton you can do this by clicking "Unfold Device Parameters" (a little 
      triangle where you dragged the effect in) and then clicking the "MIDI" 
      button at the very top right (everything will turn blue).&nbsp; Now click 
      the button you want to assign (it will appear as a slider here, but don't 
      worry it's still a button) and press the note, knob or button on your 
      controller you want to assign to it.</P>

      slider</STRONG> determines whether the numbers to the left correspond to 
      notes or CCs.&nbsp; Do you want notes to trigger the buttons or 
      controllers?</P>

      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>Metronome Volume 
      knob -</STRONG> This sets the MIDI velocity of the metronome note output. 
      To hear the metronome in Ableton, add a percussive instrument to a MIDI 
      track and set it's input to the track with Loopy Llama and it's Monitor 
      setting to "In". A planned feature is an audible metronome loaded from a 
      wav file.</P>

      src="LoopyLlamaManual_files/ll09d.png"></SPAN> <STRONG>Metronome In Mains 
      checkbox -</STRONG> When this is checked you will hear the metronome 
      output along with the loop signal. It won't ever get recorded and can be 
      turned back off at any time. Some hosts are able to utilize the third 
      output Loopy Llama has that always sends the metronome sound.</P>

      Mark</STRONG> - clicking it or the title brings up the credits 
      screen.&nbsp; Cute llama huh?&nbsp; That's about it.&nbsp; 
      Click&nbsp;anywhere to make it go away, clicking here during playback will 
      have no ill effects.</P>
      <P><STRONG>Copy Protection -</STRONG>&nbsp; It's not quite Freeware...more 
      like Free-for-now-ware.&nbsp;&nbsp;The current expiration 
      is&nbsp;September 1st, 2006 - after which&nbsp;you will only see the 
      credits screen although it will still work through automation.&nbsp; 
      Actually you could just roll the clock back on your computer if you were 
      desperate, but isn't that annoying?!&nbsp; I haven't decided what, if 
      anything, to charge or if I'll just take donations.&nbsp; I don't like the 
      idea of adding a more intrusive copy protection in the future, or the 
      thought of never being able to make money because earlier free versions 
      are out on the net... So I'm at an impasse, but it's OK as long as it's 
      still under development.&nbsp; This forces people to come back every few 
      months to get the latest version...I'll make a decision by 1.0.&nbsp; </P>
      <H2>8. Using a Foot Controller</H2>
      <P>The&nbsp;5 main buttons of Loopy Llama have MIDI support built in: 
      Record, Play, Clear, Pause,&nbsp;and Tap Tempo.&nbsp; Ableton and Bidule 
      allow you to assign MIDI CC's to controllers with their own methods, but 
      some hosts don't and this can be more convenient.&nbsp; Using the boxes 
      across the bottom enter any MIDI controller number or note number.&nbsp; 
      Use the "CCs/Notes" toggle to change whether all the buttons respond to 
      notes or CCs.&nbsp; Figuring out what note number you need can be a bit 
      difficult, so that is only there if you really need it.&nbsp; It can come 
      in handy if for example you want to assign the top 3 notes of your 
      keyboard to work the buttons rather than have a seperate MIDI 
      controller.&nbsp; Any note velocity or CC value except 0 will trigger a 
      button - so if you have to use a knob or slider to trigger a button, just 
      give it a quick nudge.</P>
      <P>Any foot controller should be able to send MIDI Continuous Controller 
      messages&nbsp;(known as&nbsp;"CC"s).&nbsp; How to setup your foot 
      controller is a matter for your user manual.&nbsp; Loopy Llama's record 
      button defaults to CC 40, and you need to send a full on value to trigger 
      it (128 or 7F in hex).&nbsp;I have noticed that some foot pedals are able 
      to alternate between a high and low CC value and others only send one 
      value.&nbsp; For this reason there is the distinction between "Momentary" 
      and "toggle"&nbsp; in the "Fell &amp; MIDI" setting under the "Record 
      Button" group.&nbsp; If your footcontroller only sends one value per 
      button then leave it on Toggle mode and the Record button will toggle on 
      and off every time it receives that message.&nbsp; If&nbsp;your 
      controller&nbsp;can alternate between 128 and 0, then you may prefer 
      "On/Off" mode which follows the value of the controller...that way you can 
      have a light on your footpedal turn on when it is recording and off when 
      you are not... Unfortunately the other buttons always work the same - they 
      will be "clicked" only if they get a non-zero value, so you may have to 
      hit your controller button twice if it must toggle.</P>
      <P>You can get&nbsp;MIDI assignment&nbsp;functionality in Ableton by 
      clicking "Unfold Device Parameters" (a little triangle where you dragged 
      the effect in) and then clicking the "MIDI" button at the very top right 
      (everything will turn blue).&nbsp; Now click the button you want to assign 
      (it will appear as a slider here, but don't worry it's still a button) and 
      press the note, knob or button on your controller you want to assign to 
      it.</P>
      <H2>9. Anything else?</H2>
      <P>This is a program meant to inspire and create...which is what I'd 
      rather be doing right now... so I may not have written the most thorough 
      manual.&nbsp; If you still have questions use the Contact Us link below 
      and send them my way.&nbsp; I also answer questions publicly in the Loopy 
      Llama Q&amp;A forum and update this manual online as things develop.&nbsp; 
      If you have recordings that feature my plugins send them my way and I'll 
      post them.&nbsp; Have fun,</P>
