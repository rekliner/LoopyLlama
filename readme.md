Loopy Llama

This is an audio plugin built on the Steinberg VST2 SDK.  It emulates hardware looping pedals of its day such as the Lexicon Jam Man or Line 6 DL-4.  I'll leave the details to the manual.
It stepped a bit ahead of the VST architecture in that it trasmitted tempo data from a slider or tap tempo to the VST host.  Hosts were just beginning to accept that data even though that part of the API was not yet developed.
This meant it could be used live to set an unlimited number of loops locked in time with the first. (before Ableton accepted tap-tempo or had a Looper plugin built in) 
Development began in 2003 and ceased in 2006.  Ableton Live pretty much absorbed all of these features.  And Mobius...it was really taking off around then.
